            <h2>Lab 02 Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                During Lab 02, I published my first web page, which was quite challenging. 
                I had to use multiple resources for guidance, but I eventually figured it out. 
                HTML helped me get a better understanding of how websites are built and viewed. 
                I learned that index.html must be used to publish a website and realized that 
                this class is more demanding than I initially thought.

            <h2>Lab 03 Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                In Lab 03, I delved deeper into web development by learning about CSS and its 
                integration with HTML. I discovered how to use embedded styles to enhance the 
                appearance of my web pages. The concept of selectors became clearer, and I learned 
                how to target specific elements, use classes, and apply ID selectors. I also 
                gained experience in setting background colors, adjusting text properties, and 
                styling links. Moreover, I understood the importance of validating both HTML and 
                CSS to ensure my code meets web standards.
